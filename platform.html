            <h1>Notitia's Foundation Guild&trade; Microbiome R&D Platform</h1>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="frame grid-center-items" data-aos="shrink">
        <p>
            Based on these Four Pillars and the ground-breaking scientific discoveries, we have developed the Foundation
            Guild&trade; Microbiome R&D Platform that serves as the basis of various technologies for promoting the
            Foundation Guild&trade; in patients and the generally healthy population.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notitia's platform and technologies are centered on the Foundation Guild&trade; gut bacteria, which has been
            proven to have a causal relationship with human health and diseases. Our proprietary data analysis pipeline
            allows us to study members of the Foundation Guild&trade; at the strain-level and examine relationships
            within their respective guilds. This entire process does not rely on existing references, enabling us to
            discover new bacteria that could be important to human health.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most important aspects of our platform is its ability to analyze and adjust Foundation
            Guild&trade; gut bacteria in each individual. The platform is made up of three unique technologies:
        </p>
        <h1>1. Testing the Foundation Guild&trade;</h1>

        <p class="sixty-percent">
            Notitia has created a predictive analysis method to identify the Foundation Guild&trade; in each
            person's gut microbiota. We can analyze an individual's fecal sample and investigate: does this
            individual have Foundation Guild&trade; bacteria in their gut? If so, what are the specific members
            of their Foundation Guild&trade;? What kind of nutrients are required to support their growth? The
            analysis can also predict the optimal state of the Foundation Guild&trade; for each person and keep
            track of their recovery and progression.
            
</p>

        <h1>2. Growing the Foundation Guild&trade;</h1>

        <p class="">
            Notitia has invented a system to isolate and grow the Foundation Guild&trade; bacteria from fecal
            samples. We can exclude all other microorganisms inside the fecal sample and isolate only the
            Foundation Guild&trade; bacteria. Regardless of the number of specific bacteria one person has in
            their Foundation Guild&trade;, our method allows us to isolate the entire group as a whole and store
            it in a cryogenic repository for future use.
            Additionally, this technology enables us to create LBP (live biotherapeutic products) drugs, which
            contain the Foundation Guild&trade; bacteria to administer to patients that need microbiota
            transplantation.
        </p>

        <h1>3. Nutrition for the Foundation Guild&trade;</h1>

        <div class="sixty-percent">
            <p>
                Notitia has designed formulas that contain the proper nutrients to support the Foundation
                Guild&trade; growth for patients and the generally healthy. These formulas contain critical
                ingredients such as complex carbohydrates and phytochemicals with antioxidant activity. Each
                ingredient is designed to be efficiently utilized by the Foundation Guild&trade;.
            </p>
            <p>
                The clinical formula focuses on supporting as many types of Foundation Guild&trade; bacteria
                there are in the human gut. In contrast, the non-clinical formula aids the most common
                Foundation Guild&trade; members and is a versatile food ingredient.
