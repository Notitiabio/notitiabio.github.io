            <p>The complex and dynamic nature of gut microbiota raises significant challenges for understanding its role
                in
                human health and diseases. To overcome these challenges, our scientific co-founder, Dr. Liping Zhao, has
                spent the past three decades to develop a conceptual framework encompassing Four Pillars to guide
                microbiome
                research and promote understanding of the role of gut microbiome in human health and diseases.</p>

            <h2>Pillar 1: We must move from association to causation.</h2>
            <p class="seventy-percent">
                To date, plenty of studies have shown that patients of various diseases have different microbiota
                compared
                to healthy individuals. There is also significant evidence identifying diet as the main force for
                shaping
                the composition of the gut microbiota. Thus, the key to changing the gut microbiota lies in dietary
                changes.
                However, in many cases it is still unclear whether changes in a patient’s gut microbiota are the cause
                or
                the end result of a disease? Changing one’s diet can simultaneously impact gut microbiota composition
                and
                patient health outcome. However, does the changed gut microbiota also improve health? Or is it merely an
                end
                result of the improved health?
            </p>

                Some bacteria are more frequently found in healthy people, while other bacteria are more frequently
                found in
                patients. Nevertheless, such association evidence cannot prove whether a bacterium is beneficial or
                harmful.
                Moving from studying association to studying causality, we must isolate the gut bacteria and inoculate
                them
                into germ-free animal models to test their health effects. <a
                    href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2012153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">In 2012, Dr.
                    Zhao found a particular pathogen
                    overgrown in a morbidly obese patient's gut.</a> After receiving a microbiome-targeted diet, the
                pathogen
                quickly reduced from 1/3 of the patient’s gut bacteria population to a non-detectable level. At the same
                time, this patient lost 110 lbs of his initial body weight and recovered from type 2 diabetes. Dr. Zhao
                hypothesized that this pathogen played a causal role in the patient's obesity and type 2 diabetes. This
                pathogen was then isolated from the patient's baseline samples and transferred to a germ-free mice gut.
                <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2012153/figures/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The
                    lab results clearly showed that this pathogen induced obesity, fatty liver, and early diabetes
                    in the recipient mice.</a> Dr. Zhao then identified the exact molecule from the pathogenic bacteria
                that is responsible for causing the diseases. For the first time, science proved that certain “bad” gut
                bacteria can CAUSE obesity and type 2 diabetes.
            </p>

                <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6380/1151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">In 2018,
                    Dr. Zhao found that some bacteria are scarce in the gut of type 2 diabetes patients.</a> After
                patients
                received a microbiome-targeted diet, these bacteria became abundant in the gut. Meanwhile, patients
                showed
                significant improvement in their health indicators. He then isolated these bacteria and transferred them
                to
                diabetic mice. <a
                    href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2018/03/07/359.6380.1151.DC1/aao5774_Zhao_SM.pdf"

                    diabetes.</a> These bacteria are proven
                beneficial!
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that conducting causality studies with a molecular level of rigor is key to establish our
                confidence to use bacteria and their effector molecules as biomarkers and targets for disease prevention
                or
                treatment.

                    Strains are the basic units of bacteria just as human individuals are the basic units of the human
                    species.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a species, human individuals share 99.9% of their genetic code which means that they are
                    biologically
                    similar to each other. <a href="" target="_blank">However, bacterial strains in the same species
                        only share 70% of their genetic
                        code.</a> As a reference, humans and mice still share 90% of their genetic code. This means that
                    the
                    difference between two strains within the same bacterial species can be greater than the difference
                    between humans and mice.

            </div>
            <img class="pillar-img" src="images/taxonomy.png" alt="taxonomy chart">
            <p>
                Because of such vast genetic differences within the same bacterial species, some bacteria can be
                pathogenic and others can be beneficial. We cannot collectively talk about bacterial species as good or
                bad. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep27572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">In 2016, Dr.
                    Zhao found one strain that can aggravate gut inflammation and colitis</a> in a supposedly
                beneficial species of gut bacteria. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02995-4"
                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">In 2017, he discovered that a healthy diet does not promote all the
                    strains belonging to a supposedly beneficial species.</a> Many of the strains were, in fact,
                non-responders
                to the healthy diet.
            </p>
            <p>
                We cannot use species as functional units to understand the role of the gut microbiota in human health
                and diseases because their members often do not behave in the same way. We need to reach strain-level
                specificity if we desire to identify whether a bacterium is good or bad to our health.

            <h2>Pillar 3: We must remember that bacteria form ecological guilds.</h2>
            <p>
                Members in an ecosystem (e.g., a rain forest) are dependent on each other. They form an ecological
                structure called a guild. Each guild is a coherent functional group of various members which either
                thrive or decline together. Dr. Zhao found that bacterial strains in the gut ecosystem also organize
                themselves into guilds. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396415300645"
                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">In 2015, Dr. Zhao identified three beneficial and nine harmful
                    guilds in the gut
                    of genetically obese children.</a> This was the first time that the guild concept was utilized in
                human
                microbiome research
            </p>
            <p class="">
                In nature, we understand that some members within an ecosystem are more important than others. The tall
                tree species in the rain forest are known as the foundation species because they dominate the ecosystem
                in abundance and influence, structuring and stabilizing the entire rainforest. Foundation species are
                different from keystone species, which have limited influence. If you lose a keystone species, you may
                lose part of the ecosystem. If you lose the foundation species, you will eventually lose everything. Are
                there any gut bacteria that also work as the foundation species to structure and stabilize the healthy
                gut microbiota?

                    Dr. Zhao discovered the first example of the foundation species in the gut microbiota.</a> When at
                a high level, this guild of beneficial bacteria can effectively change the entire gut environment and
                make it unfavorable to pathogens in the gut. This guild plays a fundamental role in structuring and
                stabilizing the healthy gut microbiota. Bacteria from various groups can be found within this guild. We
                have named this group of bacteria the "Foundation Guild&trade;" of the gut microbiome.
                <br><br>
                Because of the critical role that the Foundation Guild&trade; plays in a healthy gut microbiota,
                promoting and restoring this group should be the focus of any effective microbiome therapeutics.
