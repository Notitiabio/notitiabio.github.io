            Notitia's groundbreaking discovery in the ecological structure of the gut microbiome, matched with our
            revolutionary Foundation Guild Microbiome R&D Platform, allows us to develop unique and effective treatments
            for various chronic or acute complications.
            <br><br>
            Our studies have shown that many patients' conditions are either caused or aggravated by the loss of the
            Foundation Guild bacteria in their gut microbiome. Different pathogens guilds can produce many toxins that
            damage the body, but if the Foundation Guild bacteria are dominant, the dangerous bacteria can no longer
            survive in the gut and they and their toxins will be flushed out of the body.

        <h2 class="full">NM108</h2>
        Nutritional Medicine (NM108): a nutrient formula that can promote the growth of the pre-existing
        core and peripheral members of the Foundation Guild of patients. This product can be used individually for
        early-stage patient or used in conjunction with the BM for end-stage patients.


        <h4>Product Overview</h4>

        NBT-NM108 is an investigational, oral, high-fiber nutrient-mix drink for the treatment of COVID-19 and other
        respiratory viral infections in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes. The FDA has allowed the
        product to be tested in a phase 2a clinical trial to assess its efficacy in diabetic and prediabetic COVID-19
        patients.

        <h4>Mechanism of Action</h4>

        NBT-NM108’s proprietary formula contains nutrients that can support the growth of the Foundation Guild bacteria
        and, in turn, suppress the pathogens that are responsible for secondary complications.

        The use of this product will reduce symptom severity, lower the needs of hospitalization, and reduce the risk of
        sepsis in patients with pre-existing conditions.

        <h4>Unmet Need in COVID-19</h4>

        Currently, there are no treatments available for high-risk patients that can decrease the rate of complications
        and reduce hospitalizations while the patients are still in home isolation.

        High-risk COVID-19 patients with pre-existing conditions such as T2D, prediabetes, and obesity, have an
        over-growth of endotoxin producing pathogens in the gut. These dangerous pathogens could potentially aggravate
        inflammation and induce sepsis and other secondary complications if translocated across the gut epithelium to
        internal organs.

        Over 62% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibit digestive symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal
        pain. SARS-CoV-2 virus particles have also been cultured from patient’s fecal samples. All this evidence
        indicates that gut viral infection in COVID-19 patients is common. Gut infections damage the gut epithelium
        cells and make the gut “leaky”. Thus, the over-growing endotoxin producers would translocate through the “leaky”
        gut and worsen symptoms and induce secondary complications that require hospitalization and elevate mortality.

        NBT-NM108 is designed to decrease the rate of complications and reduce hospitalizations in high-risk COVID-19
        patients by suppressing the pathogens in the body through supporting the Foundation Guild in the gut microbiome.

        <h4>Status of Clinical Program</h4>

        Notitia is evaluating the efficacy of NBT-NM108 in a phase 2a clinical study in COVID-19 patients with type 2
        diabetes and prediabetes. You can learn more about our on-going clinical trials here.
