            <div class="paragraph">
                The gut microbiome, or sometimes referred to as the gut microbiota, is the total complement of
                microorganisms living inside the human gastrointestinal tract. The complexity and density of bacteria in
                our gut is such that it can be called our microbial Amazon Jungle. Within the 2kg (4.4 lbs.) of microbes
                that each of us carries in our guts, there are at least 1000 species of bacteria that produce various
                metabolites and large molecules, which can interact with our body daily. This molecular crosstalk
                between the gut microbiome and the human body is the key to how these microbes can affect our health.
                <br><br>
                One example of molecular crosstalk between the gut microbiome and the human body is the production of
                short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) through bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers. The human host diet
                provides dietary fibers as energy sources to support bacterial growth, and in return, the bacteria
                generate SCFAs. The SCFAs are beneficial to the human body in that they provide energy substrate to
                colonocytes, mitigate inflammation, and regulate satiety. The deficiency of SCFA production has been
                associated with many diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and colon cancer.

            “[The Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade;] plays a fundamental role in structuring a healthy gut microiome and
            keeping it
            stable”
            <br>
            <br>
            -Dr. Liping Zhao, Co-founder of Notitia Biotechnologies
        </div>
        <div class="square middle-blue-green">
            <div class="paragraph">
                Dr. Liping Zhao, the co-founder of Notitia Biotechnologies, discovered in 2018 that just as tall-trees
                are the foundation species of the rainforest, a select group of gut bacteria works as the foundation
                species of the gut ecosystem. They play a fundamental role in structuring a healthy gut microbiome and
                keeping it stable. This group of bacteria is called the “Foundation Guild.”
                <br>
                <br>
                The Foundation Guild suppresses disease-causing gut bacteria by acidifying the gut environment,
                producing anti-microbial compounds, and occupying available ecological niches. When the Foundation Guild
                diminishes below a critical level, the gut ecosystem starts to collapse, and different pathogens can
                overgrow and take over the microbiome, consequently inducing or aggravating various diseases ranging
                from chronic diseases such as diabetes and colon cancer to complications of influenza infection.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="square space-cadet">
            In a clinical trial published in the journal Science, Dr. Zhao’s team tested the Foundation Guild concept on
            type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. The team formulated a specific diet, rich in nutrients to support the
            Foundation Guild bacteria. The diet promoted these essential gut bacteria (circles in the left of the
            image) and alleviated T2D significantly by suppressing the pathogen bacteria (diamonds in the right of the
            image). Patients in the treatment group had an average of 20% decrease in HbA1c level, and more than 80% of
            the patients achieved adequate glycemic control (A1C less than 7% for T2D patients) by the end of the
            3-month trial. In two other clinical studies, the Zhao team was able to alleviate childhood genetic obesity
            and adult metabolic syndrome with the same principle. Patients in the trials lost 10-20% of their initial
            body weight over 3 months and improved fasting glucose level, lipid profile, and fatty liver, etc.
            <br><br>
            These studies, along with many other similar clinical and animal trials from Dr. Zhao’s lab, provide robust
            evidence to support the importance of the Foundation Guild in structuring a healthier gut microbiome and
            contributing to human health.
