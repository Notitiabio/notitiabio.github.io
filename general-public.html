        <h2 class="full">Why live with a damaged gut microbiome when you could fix it with nutrition</h2>
        <p class="full">Even though you may feel okay, your Foundation Guild may have already suffered damages from the
            constant attack of the pathogen guild and other outside influences. We have found that even clinically
            healthy individuals only have 2-5% of Foundation Guild bacteria in their gut microbiome. However, this
            number could increase by 10x with the right nutritional support. This means that almost every person needs
            to protect and promote their Foundation Guild before their gut microbiome experiences irreversible damage
            and "extinction" of the critical Foundation Guild bacteria.</p>

        <p class="full">
            Instead of recommending diets that works with the damaged gut microbiome, we developed a different approach,
            we created a comprehensive strategy that uses a three-step process to analyze, promote, and preserve the
            healthy Foundation Guild bacteria in every person, so that their gut microbiome may be repaired.

        <p class="full">Understand your Foundation Guild using our Foundation Guild Microbiome Analysis Test
            kit(FG-A Kit)
            <br>
            <br>
            Because the Foundation Guild is a special group of bacteria within the broader gut microbiome, we have
            developed our own unique analysis method to work with this data. Conventional microbiome test kits use a
            method that is not accurate nor precise enough to mine the data related to the Foundation Guild. Our test
            kit and analysis pipeline can discover the novel Foundation Guild bacteria in every person's gut, no matter
            how small of a percentage they are in the beginning.
            <br>
            <br>
            The test kit is also easy to use, just follow the simple instructions in each kit and mail the samples back
            to us, and you will receive your Foundation Guild result directly to your smartphone in 2-3 weeks.

        <p class="full">Fix your damaged Foundation Guild with our Foundation Guild Microbiome Dietary Supplement (MDS Series)
<br>
<br>
            A dietary supplement version based on our Nutritional Medicine (NM Series) for patients, this product promotes the growth of only the core members of the Foundation Guild that is shared by most individuals from different diet/ethnic backgrounds. Our patented formula contains the necessary nutrients and protectants that are specially formulated to support only the Foundation Guild bacteria. Take it 3 scoops each day, and you will feel a dramatic difference in your gut health and overall health. You can suspend the powder in water and drink it directly, or you can add it into your favorite smoothie blend.

        <h2 class="full">Step 3</h2>
        <p class="full">Ppreserve your newly promoted Foundation Guild with our Foundation Guild Bio-banking Service (FG-B Kit)
<br><br>
            Just like having a back-up copy of your most important files, your Foundation Guild bacteria are too important to not have a back-up, in case you lose them again. This way, even if you lose critical members of the Foundation Guild from later antibiotics use for example, you could still get your own Foundation Guild back without relying on or worrying about the compatibility of donor samples. 
            <br><br>    
            Once you have taken our MDS product for 3 months, we will send you another FG-A Kit to confirm that your Foundation Guild bacteria has recovered to the healthiest level, and if that's the case, you will receive a FG-B kit to collect more fecal sample. As soon as your FG-B kit arrives to our lab, we will isolate and purify your Foundation Guild bacteria into pure culture and store them safely in our -80C cryogenic storage. If you ever need to use them again, we will create your own personalized Foundation Guild formulation. 
            <br><br>
            The bacteria that we discover from your sample will also be used in our generic Bacterial Medicine (BM) drugs and therapies for patients with different kinds of chronic conditions. So rest assured that even if you are not using your Foundation Guild samples, they are been used in clinical trials to treat patients that are suffering from various unmet medical needs.
