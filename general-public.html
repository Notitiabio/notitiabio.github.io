        <p class="full">Even though you may feel okay, your Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; could have already been damaged
            significantly. We have found that even clinically healthy individuals only have 2-5% of Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade;
            bacteria in their gut microbiome. However, this number could increase by 10x with the right nutritional
            support.

            <br><br>
            Instead of recommending diets that works with the damaged gut microbiome, we created a comprehensive
            strategy that uses a three-step program to analyze, repair, and preserve your Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; bacteria.

            <h2>Step 1</h2>  
            <p>Analyze your Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; using our Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; Microbiome Analysis Test kit(FG-A Kit)
            <br>
            <br>
            Conventional microbiome test kits use a method that is not accurate nor precise enough to mine the data related to the Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade;. Our test kit and analysis pipeline can discover the novel Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; bacteria in every person's gut, no matter how small of a percentage they are in the beginning. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The test kit is also easy to use, just follow the simple instructions in each kit and mail the samples back to us, and you will receive your Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; result directly to your smartphone.

            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>Repair your damaged Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; with our Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; Microbiome Dietary Supplement (MDS Series)
                <br>
                <br>
                A dietary supplement version based on our Nutritional Medicine (NM108) for patients, this supplement promotes the Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; that is shared by most individuals from different diet/ethnic backgrounds. 
                <br><br>
                Our patented formula contains the necessary nutrients and protectants that are specially formulated to support only the Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; bacteria. Take it 3 scoops each day, and you will feel a immediate and dramatic difference in your body. 
                <br><br>
                You can suspend the powder in water and drink it directly, or you can add it into your favorite smoothie blend. The formula is so versatile that you can even make bread, muffin, waffle, or pancakes with it!

            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>Preserve your newly promoted Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; with our Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; Bio-banking Service (FG-B Kit)
                <br><br>
                Just like having a back-up copy of your most important files, your Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; bacteria are too important to not have a back-up. This way, even if you lose them in the future (from antibiotics use for example), you could still get your own Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; back. 
                <br><br>
                Once we have confirmed that your Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; bacteria has recovered to the healthiest level, you will receive a FG-B kit to collect more fecal sample. As soon as your sample arrives to our lab, we will isolate and purify your Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; bacteria into pure culture and store them in our -80C cryogenic storage. 
                <br><br>
                The bacteria that we discover from your sample will also be used in our generic Bacterial Medicine (BM306) for patients. So rest assured that even if you are not using your Foundation&nbsp;Guild&trade; samples, they are been put to good use in clinical trials to treat patients that are suffering from various unmet medical needs.
